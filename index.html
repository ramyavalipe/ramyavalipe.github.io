    <p>Hi, I'm Ramya, a Master’s student in Information Technology & Management at UT Austin with a background in Management Information Systems and a minor in political and moral philosophy. I work at the intersection of technology, ethics, and public interest, focusing on persuasive tech system design and governance. I ask: how do we make technology designed for human flourishing a reality? I see ethical foresight in product strategy not as a another box to be checked off but as the key to mitigating business risk and encouraging long-term revenue growth. 

My research centers on AI-backed recommendation algorithms, platform responsibility, and how product choices influence democratic discourse. I’ve written extensively on algorithmic accountability and earned recognition for my undergraduate thesis, where I developed original frameworks addressing AI risk, legal liability, and ethical system design. Professionally, I’ve contributed across policy, strategy, and research, co-authoring tech policy newsletters in D.C. and delivering data-driven insights for Gartner executives.

I’m passionate about roles that connect ethical foresight with product decisions, helping teams build technology that’s innovative, responsible, and resilient. I believe ethical persuasive tech products will define the next wave of competitive advantage in tech.
